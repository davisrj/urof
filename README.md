![UROF - Universal Role-Playing Open Framework](/UROF-logo.png?raw=true "UROF")

UROF is a free, open, universal role-playing game framework. It is designed to offer a comprehensive base game system which can easily be modified and added to by creators to make their own games and systems. Additionally, UROF is released under CC-BY-4.0 which means that these creations can then be shared, even comercially; the only requirement is proper attribution to UROF.

UROF is written in LaTeX such that it can be easily modified by creators. Whilst UROF was written using Overleaf, other LaTeX editors should work. The LaTeX code and a compiled .PDF of UROF can be found at the UROF Github repository at https://github.com/davisrj/urof​​ and the UROF itch page at https://davisrj.itch.io/urof​.

Examples of games which utilise UROF include:
